"""defeater.py — D-5 Defeater / Counterfactual Reasoning Causal Integration.



Implements the seven-gate model:
  INVOKED → PRODUCED → REFERENCED → EVALUATED → BELIEF_UPDATED
    → DECISION_RELEVANT → CONCLUSION

Architecture invariants (SENTINEL-approved):
  1. Defeaters challenge RELIABILITY CONDITIONS supporting H, not ¬H.
  2. Generator depends only on cognitive-visible state.
  3. Identical cognitive-visible state + different hidden evaluator truth
     → equivalent defeater triggers (excluding IDs/timestamps).
  4. BaseCandidates(FULL) == BaseCandidates(NO_DEFEATER).
     DefeaterCandidates are append-only, never modify base set.
  5. Belief-update table is a literal constant — no post-result tuning.
  6. apply_defeater_result() is the dedicated semantic boundary.
