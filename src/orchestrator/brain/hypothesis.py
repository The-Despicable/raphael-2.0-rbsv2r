"""hypothesis.py — Hypothesis Manager with structured confidence and history.

Core philosophy:

A hypothesis is a mutable belief. Its confidence is NOT a single number
chosen by an LLM. It derives from structured factors:

    confidence = f(
        supporting_evidence,      # EvidenceGraph edges of type SUPPORTS
        contradicting_evidence,   # EvidenceGraph edges of type CONTRADICTS
        source_reliability,       # Mean trust_level of supporting sources
        independence,             # How many independent sources agree
        freshness,                # Time-weighted decay of evidence
        assumptions_required,     # Number/strength of unproven premises
        falsification_attempts,   # Number of failed attempts to falsify
    )

CRITICAL: The complete confidence history is preserved:
    0.30 → 0.57 → 0.81 → 0.42 → FALSIFIED
    with the reason for EVERY transition recorded.

This enables learning from being wrong — the most valuable signal.
